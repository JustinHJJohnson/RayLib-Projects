# RayLib Visualizations and Toys

This is my repository where I am fiddling around with the [C version](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) of the [RayLib library](https://www.raylib.com/index.html) to makes some visualizations and other toys/programs mostly inpired by the The Coding Train's Youtube series, [Coding Challenges](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH).

## Current Projects: 
- A reaction diffusion visualization inspired by [this Coding Train video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV9ny785UNc)
  - Works, but need some optimisation to work at higher resolutions
- A Recam√°n's Sequence visualization inspired by [this Coding Train video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhFZfzOvNTU)
  - In progress

## Setup
### Windows
For Windows using VSCode it's as an IDE it's as simple as:
- Downloading the installer from [the lastest release](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases) and installing in the default path (another path can be used, but this project is set up for the default path of C:/raylib).
- Install the "C/C++" VSCode extension
- Opening the main.code-workspace file in VSCode.
- You're good to go!
### Other platforms and IDE's
The [RayLib Wiki](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki#development-platforms) contains all the information you should need to set these projects up on any platform in your IDE of choice.
